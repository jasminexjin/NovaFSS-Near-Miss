Drivers do not stop for pedestrians despite signage and are speeding recklessly. Just in the last few months, there were multiple vehicular crashes on Random Hills Rd. with one vehicle flipped over, and during another incident, jaws of life had to be used to free the driver. This all happened in a 35 MPH speed zone. The road is straight for about 1-2 miles, which leads to drivers either ""drag racing"" and speeding at recklessly. Fairfax PD posted speed measurement devices multiple times and published the results when our HOA asked for FOIA. The data revealed measured speeds well in excess of 45 MPH with some reaching 80+ MPH during the late evening / early mornings. Repeated requests for traffic calming measures for Random Hills Rd at the county or state level have been ignored thus far.
