My wife had the pedestrian single to cross. A driver turning left (west) on catoctin had the green but not leading green for a left and almost hit my wife and child head on in the crosswalk. In addition, the pedestrian timing is far too short. I am an able bodied adult and have to walk briskly to make it in time. There is a park on the south side of catoctin that we go to frequently and the this crossing is a mess everytime. the entire street is horrendous. its a miracle there are not more crashes.
