A bicylist who thought he was in the Tour de France had his head down focused on the road he was driving on.  He drove right up the truck of the car.  There are even tire marks on the car.  No one was hurt.  He stood up and held his bike in place without falling down.  It was on the road, not the bike path he was riding beside.  The weather was good.  There were people of all ages walking their dogs on both sides of the road.  He may have even been riding over 25 miles per hour, the speed limit.  The bikes should stay on the bike path that was built and painted for them.  Not sure what year.  Spring 2015?   He did not ""miss"".  Then he yelled at the driver and said she should not have been waiting there, on the road!!!",Fairfax County,,Other,"Mid_Block,Parking_Street",,No,,,Other,Other,"The biker drove right up the trunk of the car while the car was slowing down or had her foot on the brake, so her tail lights would have been on for the biiker to see if he had been looking straight ahead, but he had his head down as if he were racing on a closed track.
