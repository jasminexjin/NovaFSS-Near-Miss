This crosswalk is very dangerous, crossing from kings park to shopping center -bad visibility of vehicles approaching from the right side because the crosswalk is on a small hill and ped can’t see the traffic coming. Some people cross just one lane of the road and are waiting in the middle of the road to cross, but drivers don’t stop to let them finish crossing safely. They couldn’t see this traffic coming when they started entering the crosswalk, because they can’t see vehicles coming up the hill after light changes for them (left turn Braddock rd to Burke lake rd). Pls install crosswalk warning light with button to press by ped to activate it and a sign “ yield to ped” with fine.
