It allows for cars to turn right from Park onto N West while there is a green signal for the W&OD trail. The right turn is more than 90 degrees and cars come flying around the corner as cyclists and pedestrians are crossing the roadway. This crossing is also used by a lot of children getting out of school.

Most pedestrians and bicyclists ignore them, contrary to City Ordinance for Falls Church (pedestrians) and City and State Law (for bicyclists). Most drivers treat these crosswalks as YIELD or STOP signs, slowing or stopping even before someone enters the crosswalk. Behavior does not match the signage, leading to confusion and danger when someone behaves atypically (e.g., a bicyclist actually stopping at the stop sign or a bus not slowing down when approaching the crosswalk).",Yes,Andrew Olesen,andrewolesen@gmail.com,,615 Lincoln Ave,,,,,,,Word of Mouth,,2/2/23 20:27,,2/2/23 20:27,,-77.17331435,38.8899579,0.6787578113169797,-1.3469284300840876,77
