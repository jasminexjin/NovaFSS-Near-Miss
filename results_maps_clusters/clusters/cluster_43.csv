They started to cross and then ran back to the side of the road to avoid being hit by a car coming from the west.  I see this kind of thing regularly from my office or kitchen windows.  It happens first, because that corner has poor visibility looking toward the west, due to a curve in the road and foliage blocking the view.  Second, we have a speeding problem on Fairway Drive.  It is not uncommon to have vehicles measured going over 50 MPH on this 25 MPH road (my neighbor has his own radar).  If I knew this database existed, I could have reported several such incidents.  Also, two of the corners at the intersection are school bus stops.",Fairfax County,,,,,No,,,,"No_Crosswalk,No_Sidewalk,No_Stop_Signs_or_Signals,Poor_Visibility","We have met with VDOT at this location and asked if we could get a crosswalk or stop sign, or just get a center line painted on the road, because people speed partly because the road is so wide, and they are often riding right down the middle of the road because there is no line.  They said no to all of these options.  No to the stop sign because they said you need to have relatively equal amount of traffic in all directions.  No to the crosswalk because of the visibility problem I mentioned, and no to the center line because they sometimes a center line can make speeding worse.

We are pursuing traffic calming measures through FCDOT's RTAP program.",Yes,Steve Sarandos,FairwayDriveSafety@gmail.com,,"11241 South Shore Rd, Reston, VA 20190",,,,,,,Next Door,,1/19/23 16:34,,1/19/23 16:34,,-77.33588706,38.96215256,0.6800178458363375,-1.3497658591474775,43
