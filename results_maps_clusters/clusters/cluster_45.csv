This is not the first time that drivers have gone through this stop sign. There are no sidewalks in our neighborhood and I am often almost hit by cars driving way too fast on Woodley, Allan, Buckelew and Shreve. Also, we have a ton of thru traffic with people who do not live in the area but are only cutting across to S West Street. This is a dangerous situation. Of note, the driver that almost hit my dog and dogwalker blew kisses to my dog walker after almost hitting them to be even more rude.",Fairfax County,,Other,Stop_Sign,Right_Turn_Lane,No,,Other,"Failure_to_Yield,Running_Light_Sign,Speeding","No_Crosswalk,No_Sidewalk,Poor_Visibility",,Yes,Allison Miller,amiller1892@gmail.com,1-732-580-4572,"7300 Woodley Place, Falls Church, VA 22046",Fairfax_County,Yes,,,,,Next Door,,5/4/23 16:18,,5/4/23 16:18,,-77.1974467,38.88817591,0.6787267097242421,-1.3473496190478313,45
