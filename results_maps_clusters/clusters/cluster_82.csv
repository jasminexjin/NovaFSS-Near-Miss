There are no traffic calming devices, and there is an apartment complex at Villa del Rey Ct; the people who live there speed through the neighborhood routinely. The posted speed limit is 25 mph, but drivers frequently drive at 50mph. 

To make matters worse, there are no sidewalks, and drainage ditches on either side of the road. Frequently people in our neighborhood park on the streets as well, narrowing the width of the street and further restricting room for pedestrians to coexist with cars safely.

I have been narrowly missed 3-4 times since we moved here in September 2021.",Fairfax County,,,,,No,,,"Failure_to_Yield,Running_Light_Sign,Speeding",Other,"Drivers do not come to complete stops at stop signs, and there are no marked pedestrian crosswalks (and no sidewalks either, of course, so I guess that point is moot).
