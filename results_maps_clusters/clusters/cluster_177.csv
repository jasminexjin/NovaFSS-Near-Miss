Glebe Rd., going onto the bike path again when this car was trying to turn right from I guess 4 mile run drive although I think it's like a dead-end for them. I don't know near that old  used to be a car dealership... anyway he couldn't see me at all so basically I had to slam on my brakes to avoid hitting him as he turned in front of me and nearly hit me in the process. I said something like"" Jeez!"" and his window was open and he said ""I'm sorry ""! I couldn't even see his face because the car was already gone ahead of me and I couldn't turn back cause I was still trying to go straight across the road to get back onto the bike path..... it's where the bike path is under construction and is rerouted. At Glebe Road bridge  coming off the 4 mile run path.... at least one if not two lanes still have barriers up and people just cannot see around the barriers at all.
