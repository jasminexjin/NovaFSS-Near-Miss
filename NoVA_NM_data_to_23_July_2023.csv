This morning my wife and two young children were waiting at the red light on the on ramp in the right lane ready to turn left onto FFX county Parkway south and when the light turned green she noticed that the car proceeding in the left lane to turn left, screeched on his brakes because a car going northbound was speeding through the red light. This was at least 2 to 3 seconds after the light and turn red. Fortunately, because the car in the left lane did that it caused my wife to pause and not proceed through the green. Otherwise she would’ve been hit by a car going at least 50mph. 

This intersection (on-ramp) from 50 onto Fairfax county parkway south is extremely dangerous. Drivers going north on Fairfax County Parkway speed through this red light all the time.
