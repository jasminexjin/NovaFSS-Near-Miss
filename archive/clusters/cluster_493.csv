The stop sign metal post is there, but no stop sign is attached to the post.  The missing sign creates a very dangerous situation, especially when traveling on Larry Rd toward Briggs road turning left with low visibility of oncoming traffic, due to vegetation.  When the stop sign was in place, traffic was required to stop on Briggs Rd. People driving on Briggs Rd do not know to stop, so this creates a very dangerous intersection.  A new stop sign needs to be installed ASAP.
