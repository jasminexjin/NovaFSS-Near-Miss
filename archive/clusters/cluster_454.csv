1919,a3f5ff34-d4be-49a5-8d97-6d08fd2131dc,Dangerous_Location,2/4/23 17:00,,Unsafe Condition,"Cyclist,Person_Walking,Person_Driving",No,Yes,"We have witnessed many near misses at our neighborhood entrance, mostly of cyclists or of cars trying to avoid them. There is a walking/cycling path along Fairfax County PKWY, and it is downhill from the PKWY, so it is hard for drivers to see a jogger or fast moving cyclist until just before their car crosses the crosswalk. When cars enter Karmich St. from FFX CNTY or Roberts PKWYs, joggers/walkers or cyclists traveling at a fast rate of speed often enter the crosswalk without checking traffic. After proceeding on a green light, I have had to slam on my breaks several times even after checking, as a fast moving cyclist entered the crosswalk at  the last second. Each time I narrowly missed getting hit from behind by a car going south or by eastbound traffic going 50mph+. I have seen this happen to others while I waited to turn left from FFX CNTY PKWY onto Karmich St.. Please install pathway stop signs, to protect pedestrians/cyclists, as well as drivers from a high-speed collision.",Fairfax County,,"Crosswalk,Trail",Traffic_Light,,No,,Other,,Poor_Visibility,Installing a path stop signs or electronic crossing light could prevent tragedy at this intersection. Drivers get short opportunities to get through this intersection to Karmich St. and the poor visibility barely allows drivers time to react to those entering the crosswalk. A car stopping on the FFX CNTY PKWY for a cyclist/pedestrian could be a fatal prospect for a driver(s) given that oncoming traffic is typically going 50-75MPH.,Yes,Jill Tyson,tysonmj@live.com,,,,,,,,,Other,Northern Virginia Magazine,2/4/23 22:50,,2/4/23 22:50,,-77.30441991,38.77980798,0.6768353325421713,-1.3492166537737584,454
