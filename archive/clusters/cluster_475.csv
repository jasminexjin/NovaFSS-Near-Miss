1981,4881ead5-3ea4-4171-823f-aaa8bff66946,Dangerous_Location,4/14/22 16:00,5,Unsafe Condition,Cyclist,No,No,"I was on my  bicycle, on Buckman Road waiting to cross Richmond Highway to the sidewalk.  In that direction Buckman has two lanes, both of which can turn left.  On the extreme right eastbound, there is no room for a bicycle to wait and no sidewalk, only a ditch.  I had filtered to the front between two cars, intending to get out in front of the cars as the light changed to both be seen and to not hold up the line of cars waiting to cross.  I woke up in the ambulance.  The police report said that the driver who hit me from behind said that he had 'lost sight of' me.  This intersection is also dangerous for the many pedestrians, as the light to cross Richmond Highway also lets two lanes of left turners cross the crosswalk on the east side.  In addition, Richmond Highway southbound has a right turning slip lane across the crosswalk, and many drivers use it.

If there were, drivers in the right hand lane proceeding straight across Richmond Highway would cross their path to the sidewalk on the other side.  The only sidewalk is on the north side of Buckman/Old Mount Vernon Highway.  ",Yes,Larry D.
