A school bus in the far lane made no attempt to yield to me (and my daughter) in the crosswalk or a pedestrian crossing from the other side. Most cars slow down at this crossing to ensure they yield to bicyclists and walkers. Some, including this school bus, barrel on through even if people are actively in the intersection.",City of Falls Church,,"Crosswalk,Trail","Mid_Block,Stop_Sign",,No,,,Failure_to_Yield,,"Stop signs on the W&OD are confusing. Most pedestrians and bicyclists ignore them, contrary to City Ordinance for Falls Church (pedestrians) and City and State Law (for bicyclists). Most drivers treat these crosswalks as YIELD or STOP signs, slowing or stopping even before someone enters the crosswalk. Behavior does not match the signage, leading to confusion and danger when someone behaves atypically (e.g., a bicyclist actually stopping at the stop sign or a bus not slowing down when approaching the crosswalk).",Yes,Andrew Olesen,andrewolesen@gmail.com,,615 Lincoln Ave,,,,,,,Word of Mouth,,2/2/23 20:27,,2/2/23 20:27,,-77.17331435,38.8899579,0.6787578113169797,-1.3469284300840876,451
