A Tesla had stopped in the middle of the crosswalk so was running behind her. She started reversing and almost ran me over.

It allows for cars to turn right from Park onto N West while there is a green signal for the W&OD trail. The right turn is more than 90 degrees and cars come flying around the corner as cyclists and pedestrians are crossing the roadway. This crossing is also used by a lot of children getting out of school. The lights should be re-done to have all red when the trail crossing is green!,City of Falls Church,,"Crosswalk,Trail",Traffic_Light,Right_Turn_Lane,No,,,"Distracted,Speeding",Poor_Visibility,,No,,,,,,,,,,,Facebook,,1/25/23 14:38,,1/25/23 14:38,,-77.1826996,38.89144438,0.6787837552872448,-1.3470922335977105,427
