Multiple times each day we observe: 1. Cars turning from Braddock or Russell into W. Alexandria Avenue and driving the wrong way down our one-way street (there are many children on our street including our toddler and infant); and 2. Cars that get so frustrated waiting for a green light on W. Alexandria Avenue that they run the red light, either by going straight onto Braddock or right on Russell. We need better signage to discourage drivers from turning the wrong way down our one-way street and should consider recalibrating the light, which seems not to register the presence of cars stopped on our street and doesnâ€™t always trip, triggering the light.",City of Alexandria,,Sidewalk,Traffic_Light,,No,,,"Improper_Right_Turn,Running_Light_Sign,Wrong_Way",Other,Need more obvious signage/to calibrate light.,Yes,Anne Malinee,anne.malinee@gmail.com,1-913-219-6225,"120 W Alexandria Avenue, Alexandria VA 22301",,,,,,,Word of Mouth,Rosemont neighborhood list serv ,4/11/23 19:33,,4/11/23 19:33,,-77.06588244,38.8180442,0.6775026804746883,-1.3450533895328813,483
