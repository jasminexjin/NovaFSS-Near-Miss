There is no way to cross the street from any direction in a safe manner, so pedestrians are now jaywalking and using the single lane road as a sidewalk (the section of 15th St S between S Eads St and Jefferson Davis Highway) which is high-traffic. There is also a closed lane in this section of street that is under construction (with many holes and dangerous hazards) that people are using to duck out of the way when cars come speeding down the single lane road. Before the crosswalks and sidewalks were closed, I have almost been hit crossing this intersection multiple times over the past year (walking this path daily) while having the right-of-way by drivers speeding through right turns on red. Now, I see multiple people every day almost get hit by these cars or injured from having to walk in the construction zones.
