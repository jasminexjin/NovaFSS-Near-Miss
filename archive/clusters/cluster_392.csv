This crosswalk is very dangerous, crossing from kings park to shopping center -bad visibility of vehicles approaching from the right side because the crosswalk is on a small hill and ped can’t see the traffic coming. Some people cross just one lane of the road and are waiting in the middle of the road to cross, but drivers don’t stop to let them finish crossing safely. They couldn’t see this traffic coming when they started entering the crosswalk, because they can’t see vehicles coming up the hill after light changes for them (left turn Braddock rd to Burke lake rd). Pls install crosswalk warning light with button to press by ped to activate it and a sign “ yield to ped” with fine. Speed limit is 35but cars don’t stop to let ped cross or finish crossing the road safely ",Fairfax County,,Crosswalk,,,No,,,,"No_Stop_Signs_or_Signals,Not_Enough_Time_To_Cross,Poor_Visibility","I described just two situations but this is happening every day. People living in kings park are walking to/from the shopping center, there are school kids walking to giant or to martial arts school there. Pedestrians have to run to cross this crosswalk safe, older people don’t even have a chance to do so. Cars are coming all the time, if the traffic from left turn Braddock rd to Burke lake rd stops and Burke lake rd from the other side stops as well then turn on red rolling road to Burke lake keeps going. Pedestrians have almost no chance to cross safely. ",No,,,,,,,,,,,Facebook,,2/16/23 14:34,,2/16/23 14:34,,-77.25283194,38.80931016,0.6773502427196874,-1.3483162738428385,392
