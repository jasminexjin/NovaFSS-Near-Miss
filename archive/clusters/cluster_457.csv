I’ve almost been hit many times on foot/biking from west side of Huntsman, crossing 286 towards Huntsman Sq/Orange Hunt by people rolling into crosswalk making right onto Huntsman from 286N. People regularly ignore no UTurn going north turning to go South. People on 286 blatantly run red light at high speeds.As a driver, you cannot see cyclists heading N on 286 bike trail when going right onto 286 S from Huntsman (west side). Many near misses as people make rights onto 286 from either side of Huntsman.  I’ve seen many wrecks here over the years and always worry about getting hit by a ricocheting car while waiting to cross. 

This is a very busy pedestrian intersection with people (incl kids/teens) crossing from Orange Hunt neighborhoods going to Burke/Mercer bike trails and many people (incl. many kids/teens) crossing from west neighborhoods to get to shopping Center.

Light at 286 is incredibly backed up and the lines pulling out of Huntsman Square are terrible. Creates frustration and impatient driving habits. That area is just a mess and dangerous. 

You should seriously consider removing right on red options from Huntsman through Roberts road onto 286. Creates very hazardous conditions for drivers and pedestrians as people roll through lights from feeder streets onto parkway. I’ve almost had to lock up many times while going 50 and someone turns in front of me from side streets. Blatant and egregious  Red light violations by people traveling on 286 happen on almost every cycle, incl many of the County Garbage trucks (tractor/trailers) going to/from Lorton and who should use 66/Beltway. I now wait a few seconds before going on green because of how many times people run the late way after red (and after my light turns green!).
