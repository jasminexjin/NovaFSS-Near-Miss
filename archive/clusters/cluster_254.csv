Myself and family members have taken walks along the south side of this road (starting from Trevor House and going east or west) and have had around 6 close calls and 1 actual physical tap (at Borge St) from unsafe drivers pulling in or out of side streets and parking lots and we JUST moved here last November 2022 (it is Marxh 2023 now). Too many! We walk with flashlights now and are considering reflective gear because it seems like the street lights just aren't enough even when we are directly under them - even flashlights don't catch the eye of drivers sometimes. Drivers making a fast left from westbound turn southward across the traffic onto side streets (closer to the Sutton) and drivers pulling out of the Treebrooke parking lot for example (near Borge) are particularly bad.,Fairfax County,,Crosswalk,"Mid_Block,Parking_Lot,Stop_Sign,Traffic_Light","Left_Turn_Lane,Right_Turn_Lane",No,,,Failure_to_Yield,"No_Stop_Signs_or_Signals,Not_Enough_Time_To_Cross,Poor_Visibility",,Yes,Rachel Guttmacher,rguttmacher@coa.edu,1-585-831-0557,"10202 Willow Mist Ct, Unit B, Oakton, VA 22124",Fairfax_County,Yes,,,,,Next Door,,3/8/23 5:44,,3/8/23 5:44,,-77.3007591,38.87511811,0.6784988081211751,-1.3491527605859686,254
