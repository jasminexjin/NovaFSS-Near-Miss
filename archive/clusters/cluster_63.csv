A pedestrian was starting to cross Duke St. (from the northwest corner of the intersection).  I was approaching the intersection (heading south on Arell Ct), when I saw the car about to run the red light, as well as the pedestrian starting to cross.  I honked my horn to alert the pedestrian about the impending danger.  This is captured on my dashcam video here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-M-xTOpu7GfBG6KfH6wQXLfpugq1K21B/view?usp=share_link
