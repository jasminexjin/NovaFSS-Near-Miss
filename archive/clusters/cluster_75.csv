Arlington Mill Dr. from the north to the south side at Campbell Avenue. While in the middle of the crosswalk over the westbound lane a car drove right behind me while I was still in the crosswalk not having reached even the median strip. It did not even slow down so may not have even seen me. Similar incidents happen ALL the time. There are SO many pedestrians crossing here, especially because of the Shirlington retail/restaurants, brewery and the dog park. I’ve lived in the neighborhood since 2016 and it has gotten worse. Drivers, especially those in the westbound lane (where the road curves preceding the crosswalk), are focused on the traffic signal at S. Arlington Mill Dr. and “Driveway” such that the crosswalk does NOT register. For pedestrian safety before someone gets seriously injured, we need flashing lights installed here !!!! PLEASE!!!! ",Arlington County,,Crosswalk,Mid_Block,Through_Lane,No,,,Failure_to_Yield,"No_Stop_Signs_or_Signals,Poor_Visibility,Other","PLEASE let’s beg the county to install yellow flashing lights here. This Crosswalk is preceded by a curvature in the road on the westbound side and is SO much more heavily used than the Xwalk 0.1 mile down the street at Windgate (around 2600 S Arlington Mill Dr),
where a flashing signal was installed. If these things happen to me as often as they do, dangerous events are occurring with incredible frequency.
