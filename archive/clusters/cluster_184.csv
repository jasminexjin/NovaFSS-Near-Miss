The intersection was clear as I told my kids to start crossing when a driver approached the intersection at high speed, ran the stop sign and barreled into the crosswalk going about 20MPH, then stopped about 5 feet into the intersection when I yelled.

Contributing factors:
Speed
Cell phone in driver's hand
Cars parked so close to the crosswalk that we can't see approaching traffic until we are in the intersection.
